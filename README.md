## Data Sources:

All data sources were collected through the Massachusetts Oliver GIS Web portal (http://maps.massgis.state.ma.us/map_ol/oliver.php). These distinct layers include soils, urban fill, and wetlands which have been processed using geoprocessing tools in QGIS to select important area boundaries and features. They were further transformed into geojson files and processed using mapboxGL to develop an interactive map.

### This project is in collaboration with Alex Kent, Landscape Architect Masters Student at The City College of New York. He provided guidance on specific layers of interest, images, and technical knowledge.
